## üî• FINAL STEP - Add Environment Variables:

### I've opened the Vercel Dashboard for you in the browser!

**Follow these simple steps:**

1. **In the browser tab that just opened**, you'll see "Environment Variables" page

2. **Click "Add New" button** (or if you see existing variables, that's fine)

3. **Add these 5 variables** (click "+ Add New" for each):

   **Variable 1:**
   ```
   Key: MONGODB_URI
   Value: [Copy from your .env.development file]
   Environment: Select all three (Production, Preview, Development)
   ```

   **Variable 2:**
   ```
   Key: JWT_SECRET
   Value: [Copy from your .env.development file]
   Environment: Select all three
   ```

   **Variable 3:**
   ```
   Key: JWT_SECRET_EXPIRY
   Value: 7d
   Environment: Select all three
   ```

   **Variable 4:**
   ```
   Key: NODE_ENV
   Value: production
   Environment: Production only
   ```

   **Variable 5:**
   ```
   Key: FRONTEND_URL
   Value: https://react-mini-ecommerce-rose.vercel.app
   Environment: Select all three
   ```

4. **Click "Save"** after adding each variable

## üöÄ After Adding Variables:

Run this command in your terminal:

```powershell
vercel --prod
```

This will deploy your app to production at:

## ‚úÖ Verify Your Deployment:

After deployment completes, test these:

1. **API Health Check:**
   https://react-mini-ecommerce-rose.vercel.app/api
   Should show: `{"message": "E-Commerce API is running!", "status": "healthy"}`

2. **Your App:**
   https://react-mini-ecommerce-rose.vercel.app
   - Try signing up
   - Try logging in
   - Browse products
   - Add to cart
